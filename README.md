# Web Search with LangChain + SerpAPI

This is a simple project where I combine **LangChain** with **SerpAPI** to perform automated web searches.  
It marks the beginning of my journey as an **AI developer**, and it's one of the first projects I am building for my GitHub portfolio.

## üìå Project Description
The script connects to **SerpAPI** using the LangChain `SerpAPIWrapper` utility.  
It performs a query about **advances in artificial intelligence in Paraguay (2025)** and prints the raw search results.

This project demonstrates:
- How to use API keys securely (environment variables).
- How to connect LangChain with external tools (SerpAPI).
- How to fetch and display web search results programmatically.
